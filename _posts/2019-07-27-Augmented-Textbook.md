This was a proof-of-concept app that I created to demonstrate how animated 3d assets can improve the traditional learning experience. 
The app was built for Android in Unity, using the ARCore SDK.

I documented some of the development experience in a [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/KPChadwick/status/1150443176492072960?s=20)

The source code is also freely available on [my github](https://github.com/kpchad/TextbookAR)
