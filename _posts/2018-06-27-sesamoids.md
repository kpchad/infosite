My research in the Structure and Motion Laboratory at the RVC was part of a grant studying the evolution and development of sesamoid bones in vertebrates, led by Prof John Hutchinson. I studied the knee joint of ostriches in order to gain insight into how and why their knee sesamoids (i.e. patellae) develop. This project began with a detailed anatomical study of all muscles, bones, tissues, and ligaments surrounding the knee. I then used this information to build FEA models to see if growth algorithms could explain their unique morphology.

I presented two posters for this project, at SEB2014 and EB2015.

The first paper for this project was an anatomical study, published in [PeerJ](https://peerj.com/articles/706/).

The second paper for this project was a finite element analysis modelling study, published in [Royal Society Open Science](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.170133).

To ready more about our journey with this research question, see John's blog post [Why do ostriches have two kneecaps in each knee?](https://whatsinjohnsfreezer.com/2017/06/08/why-2-kneecaps/).
