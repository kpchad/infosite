XRLA is the largest AR/VR/ImmersiveTech group in Los Angeles. The other co-founders and I formed the group after participating in the 2018 Creating Reality Hackathon and saw a need for a cohesive XR community in Los Angeles. Since then, the community has grown very quickly with a growing Slack workspace and monthly Meetups for networking and panels of prominent XR founders and makers.
