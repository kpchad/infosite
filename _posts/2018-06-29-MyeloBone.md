One of my research projects at the Motion Analysis Lab at Childrenâ€™s Hospital Los Angeles is related to bony deformities in children with myelomeningocele. As these children develop, their bones grow in a mechanical environment atypical to normally developing bones due to varying levels paralysis and associated adaptive gait patterns. It is unclear exactly how, and to what extent, these different loading conditions influence the cross-sectional shape of their tibias as they develop, a factor important for reducing fracture risk. The most recent publication from this project was published in the journal [Bone](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bone.2018.07.001).
