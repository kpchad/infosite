This project was made for the ATT 5G Hackathon in October, 2019.

With the tools made available to us to connect to a 5G network using a Samsung 5G phone, we set out to create an application which truly utilizied this technology. We discovered that with 5G, you can stream up to 10 HD videos simultaneously on a mobile device before you begin to be constrained by the CPU (not the bandwidth). To utilize this ability we developed a mobile VR surveilance hub for security teams. The application features a wall of streaming video feeds as well as a 3d map of the property you are surveiling (thanks to Mapbox). Video cameras associated with GPS locations on the map can be selected to bring up those particual feeds. 

Our team won:

2nd Place Overall ($20,000)

Best High-Bandwidth Use Case ($5,000)
